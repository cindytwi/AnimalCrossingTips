   <br> 1. Make a fruit tree farm! Making bells in the long run helps paying things and debt.<br><br>
    2. Save your native fruits to sell on a different island for more bells! <br><br>

    3. Save your extra bugs and fish and wait for Flick and CJ. They sell higher than Nook's Cranny. <br><br>

    4. Don't use to drop box! You only get 80% of the profits, just wait until the next day!<br><br>

    5. When you build other villager's houses, watch where you put them (same with stores!).<br>
     If you don't like them, it costs 50k bells to move each house and store! <br><br>

     6. Fish bait will help find rare fish! Rare fish is depended on luck so the more you fish, <br>
     the more likely you'll get the rare fish!<br><br>

     7. Alway hold a net when shaking trees! If a wasp comes out, catching them makes it easy.<br> Sell them to Flick!<br><br>

   <br> 1. Buy Turnips on Sunday Mornings! The stalk market is a high risk, high reward. <br>
    It is possible to predict hills and dips.<br><br>
    <img class="visitor" src="../assets/images/turnips.jpg"><img class="visitor" src="../assets/images/nookazon.JPG">  <br>
    2. There are many websites dedicated to AC:NH! turnip.exchange is a big example.<br>
    Many websites help find other islands for a high turnip price and other websites help <br>
    find furniture and wanted items! There is also a website to plan out your island! <br><br>
    <img class="turnips" src="../assets/images/stars.jpg"><br>
    3.Watch for shooting stars and Celeste! She will give a star related DIY. <br>
    Wishing upon the stars will make the beach be filled with shooting stars the next morning. <br><br>

    4. Guliver will give a item when helping him! He spawns randomly. The wisp is also <br>
    at a random spawn but shows up at night. Same concept as Guilver, he will reward you with a <br>
    new or expensive furniture.<br><br>

    5. Put a work bench everywhere! You never know when you need to craft something<br>
    It sucks to walk back and forth to your house.<br><br>
   <br>
    6. Pay your debt! The larger your house, the larger your storage is so you can collect more items <br>
    Fully paying all your debt will allow you to decorate the exterior of your house for free! <br><br>
