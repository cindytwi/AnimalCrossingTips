            <p class="body">Animal Crossing is a nice relaxing game to play at your own 
                pace but there is so much <br>the game does not tell you about.  
                These are tips that I personally wish I had when I started <br> the game!
                I hope these tips will help you and your island!
             </p> <br>

            <p class="body"> 1. It's ok if you don't like your island layout!
                                 You can edit that later on. <br><br>
                                 <img class="visitor" src="assets/images/tera.jpg"> <br><br>
                            2.Your appearance can also change once you get a mirror.<br><br>

                            3. The only thing you can't change is your Island Name and your own name! 
                            <br> So be warned!<br><br>
                            4. If you don't like the color of your airport or native fruit, 
                            you could hard reset by<br> deleting the saved data to hard reset.  <br><br>

                            <img class="visitor" src="assets/images/fruit.jpg"><br><br>
                            5. When picking a layout, the things to note is the location of the peir,<br>
                             mouths of rivers and distance from the Residential Services and Aiport.<br><br>

            <p class="body"> 
                    <BR>1. Make a quick town toon and town flag! Having Nook Miles early <br>
                    on will help pay first debt and get more NMT(Nook Mile Tickets)<br><br>
                    <img class="visitor" src="assets/images/nook miles.jpg"> <br> <br>
                    2. Easy bells you can make is selling weeds and fruit! <br>
                    (But save some weeds for crafting) <br><br>
                    <img class="visitor" src="assets/images/weeds.jpg"> <br>
                    3. Donate your first fish and bugs to Tom Nook (then soon Blathers) to get<br> the Museum upgrade! <br><br>
                   <img class="visitor" src="assets/images/nook cranny.jpg"><img class="visitor" src="assets/images/musem.png">
                   <br>
                   4. The Nook Cranny takes 30 of each wood and 30 iron nuggets so save all the<br> nuggets! <br><br>
                    5. It's ok to time travel! Its usually looked down upon but if you play at a fast <br>
                    pace then that's ok! It's not considered cheating when you're still playing the <br>
                    game with no exploits. Just watch if you have turnips (they will spoil) and a<br> 
                    little bit more weeds will grow. <br><br>
                    <img class="visitor" src="assets/images/spoiled.jpg"><BR> <BR>
                    6. Don't cut down trees with an iron axe! You can move trees with eating fruits.<br>
                    Waiting for trees to grow will take too long<br><br>
